# Gen711-Final-Project

## Background
The Original Team's Data: 

We used data that was found in a shared directory on ron. 
Steps Used to Obtain Samples:
1. Isolating bacteria
2. DNA Extraction
3. Prepare Library
4. Sequence using Illumina HiSeq 2500
- there were forward & reverse reads for each sample in FASTQ format

The Goal: To have a complete genome assembly and assessment of the chosen reads from the given data.
the chosen forward & reverse reads:
36_S3_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
36_S3_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
